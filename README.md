# PyBer_Analysis

# A written report for the PyBer analysis

## 1. **Overview of the analysis:** Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of the first section, Deliverable 1, was to show the average fare per ride and driver.
The purpose of the second section, Deliverable 2, was to plot the total weekly fares for each type of city for the months of January through April using a multiple line plot making sure each week is either peaking or dipping in the line graph.
## 2.	**Results:** Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
As shown in the imagine below, you can see that the rural cities, compared to suburban and urban cities, have a substantial less amount of rides and drivers and therefor the average fare per ride and drivers will increase in price. This could be because people that live in rural cities most likely already have a car and have no need to use the service. As opposed to people that live in urban cities, its usually more expensive to own a car there so people will opt out of owning one and will call for the service when needed.

As you can see from the chart provided below, all three city types have similar peaks and dips around the same dates. This shows us that even though rural cities have a significant amount less than Urban, depending on weather or special holidays there will be a bigger or smaller demand for rides and drivers. For example, at the beginning of the year, all three types of cities start very low due to the holiday season ending and the cold weather. More people stay inside and due to those two factors. Another example is at the end of February, there is a peak in all three different city types. This could be due to a holiday or event where more people were out and needed a ride and driver.

## 3.	**Summary:** Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
  1.	For rural type cities knowing that there is not a huge request for the service all year round, we can increase the drivers around weekend or special holiday/events that we know were busy from previous years data. That way we can make up for the rest of the year when we do not have a high demand for rides.
  2.	 A few days before a popular weekend or holiday I would send customers that have previously used the PyBer app a discount code with a percentage off for a future ride. That way we can guarantee more people will use the Pyber service instead of a competitor.
  3.	For rural and suburban cities I would advertise the PyBer app more. That way we can get more clients that might not be aware of that option as a transportation. I would suggest advertising Pyber as a service and as a job. That way we can also increase our drivers. The issue might not be that there isnâ€™t enough people interested in the service, but we might not have enough drivers and therefor the prices might go up too much that it discourages people from using the service.
